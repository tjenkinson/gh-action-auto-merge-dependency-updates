# gh-action-auto-merge-dependency-updates

A GitHub action that will automatically merge a PR that only contains dependency updates, based on some rules.

If you run tests on PR's make sure you [configure those as required status checks](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-required-status-checks) so that they need to go green before the merge can occur.

## Config

- `repo-token`: a GitHub API token. E.g. `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`
- `allowed-actors`: A comma separated list of usernames auto merge is allowed for.
- `allowed-update-types` (optional): A comma separated list of types of updates that are allowed. Supported: [devDependencies|dependencies]:[major|minor|patch]. _Default: `devDependencies:minor, devDependencies:patch`_
- `package-block-list` (optional): A comma separated list of packages that auto merge should not be allowed for.

You should configure this action to run on the `pull_request` `opened` and `synchronize` events, and `pull_request_review`.

## Example Action

```yaml
name: Auto Merge Dependency Updates

  - pull_request
